# Dependent Origination Analysis

Trace the chain of causation in any situation to understand how it arose, what sustains it, and where the chain can be broken. Based on the Buddha's teaching of Paticcasamuppada.

---

## When to Use

- User asks "How did I get into this pattern?" or "Why does this keep happening?"
- Recurring problems or cycles that seem inescapable
- Understanding the conditions that created a situation
- Finding intervention points in complex dynamics
- Breaking habits, addictions, or reactive patterns
- Request to "trace the dependent origination"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| pattern | Yes | The recurring situation, problem, or cycle to analyze |
| history | No | How long this has been happening, previous attempts to change |
| conditions | No | Known contributing factors |

## The Dependent Origination Framework

### The Buddha's Teaching

"When this exists, that comes to be. With the arising of this, that arises. When this does not exist, that does not come to be. With the cessation of this, that ceases."

Nothing arises independently. Every phenomenon emerges from conditions and, in turn, becomes a condition for other phenomena. Understanding this chain reveals where intervention is possible.

### The Twelve Links (Simplified)

The classical formulation traces the cycle of rebirth, but the principle applies to any pattern:

1. **Ignorance** (not seeing clearly) leads to...
2. **Volitional formations** (habitual reactions) which condition...
3. **Consciousness** (a particular way of perceiving) which shapes...
4. **Mind-body** (the felt sense of self in situation) which activates...
5. **Six sense bases** (how we take in experience) which enable...
6. **Contact** (encounter with objects/situations) which produces...
7. **Feeling** (pleasant, unpleasant, neutral) which triggers...
8. **Craving** (wanting or not-wanting) which intensifies into...
9. **Clinging** (grasping, identification) which fuels...
10. **Becoming** (the momentum toward a certain existence) which results in...
11. **Birth** (the pattern manifesting again) which inevitably involves...
12. **Suffering** (aging, death of the pattern, starting again)

### Applied Analysis Framework

#### Step 1: Map the Pattern

**What is the recurring situation?**
- What happens?
- How often does it repeat?
- What is the suffering involved?

**Identify the "birth" moment:**
- When does the pattern fully manifest?
- What does it look like in its complete form?

#### Step 2: Trace Backward - What Conditions Led Here?

**Immediate conditions:**
- What happened right before the pattern emerged?
- What craving or aversion was present?
- What were you clinging to? (outcome, identity, feeling)

**Underlying conditions:**
- What habitual reactions were activated?
- What way of seeing/not seeing set this up?
- What beliefs or assumptions were operating?

**Distal conditions:**
- What in your history created vulnerability to this pattern?
- What environmental factors contribute?
- What relationships or structures sustain it?

#### Step 3: Identify Key Links

**The craving-clinging nexus:**
Most patterns can be interrupted at the craving-clinging transition. This is where feeling (pleasant/unpleasant) triggers automatic wanting, and wanting solidifies into grasping.

**Questions:**
- What feeling arises that triggers the craving?
- What is being craved? (pleasure, relief, validation, escape)
- What identity or outcome is being clung to?

#### Step 4: Find Intervention Points

**Where can the chain be broken?**

Not every link is equally accessible. Examine:

- **At ignorance:** Can clearer understanding prevent the pattern from starting?
- **At contact:** Can the triggering situation be avoided or changed?
- **At feeling:** Can the feeling be experienced without automatic reaction?
- **At craving:** Can the wanting be noticed and not acted upon?
- **At clinging:** Can the grasping be loosened?

**Key insight:** The earlier in the chain you intervene, the less energy is required. But even late intervention (at clinging) can break the cycle.

#### Step 5: Formulate the Path Out

Based on the analysis, identify:
- What needs to be seen clearly (wisdom)
- What behavior needs to change (ethics)
- What mental training is required (meditation)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

## Constraints

- Do not oversimplify - patterns are genuinely complex
- Do not blame - conditions arose from conditions; there is no original fault
- Do not promise instant change - some chains have deep roots
- Remember: understanding the chain is itself a form of intervention (wisdom)

## Example

**Input:** "I keep getting into relationships with emotionally unavailable people. It's happened three times now. Each time I think it will be different, but I end up heartbroken and confused."

**Output:**

## Dependent Origination Analysis

### The Pattern
You enter relationships with emotionally unavailable partners, despite recognizing this pattern intellectually. Each relationship follows a similar trajectory: hope, confusion, heartbreak. The pattern repeats.

### The Chain of Arising

**Distal conditions:**
There is likely a historical component - perhaps early experiences where love was inconsistent or conditional, creating a template where unavailability feels familiar. This is not blame; these conditions arose from conditions themselves. But they created a particular vulnerability.

**Underlying conditions:**
- A belief that love must be earned or won
- A sense that available love would be less valuable or trustworthy
- An identity organized around "the one who tries harder"
- A way of seeing that interprets distance as depth, unavailability as complexity

**Immediate conditions:**
When you meet someone unavailable, certain signals register as attraction:
- Mystery (they're hard to read) - interpreted as interesting
- Inconsistency (sometimes close, sometimes distant) - creates intensity
- Challenge (you can't quite reach them) - activates effort

These would be warning signs for someone with different conditioning. For you, they feel like chemistry.

**The craving:**
At feeling level: there is something that feels like excitement, anticipation, aliveness when encountering these signals.
At craving level: wanting to be the one who finally gets through, wanting to prove your worth, wanting the validation of being chosen by someone who doesn't easily choose.

**The clinging:**
Identification with being the devoted partner, the one who sees their potential. Clinging to hope: "This time will be different." Clinging to the relationship itself, even as evidence mounts that it cannot give what you need.

**The birth:**
The relationship manifests in its full form: you over-giving, them withdrawing, you trying harder, them withdrawing further. The pattern is born again.

**The suffering:**
Heartbreak, confusion, self-doubt. Questions like "What's wrong with me?" which often lead to either:
- Withdrawal ("I'm done with relationships") - until loneliness triggers the cycle again
- Or immediate searching ("The next one will be different") - which often finds another unavailable person

### Intervention Points

| Link | Accessibility | Intervention |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| Distal conditions | Low | Therapy to process historical patterns; long-term work |
| Underlying beliefs | Medium | Examining beliefs about love, worth, and availability |
| Contact | Medium | Recognizing early warning signs before attachment forms |
| Feeling | Medium-High | Noticing when "chemistry" is actually activation of old patterns |
| Craving | High | Pausing when attraction arises; asking "What am I actually wanting here?" |
| Clinging | Medium | Loosening grip on hope when evidence contradicts it |

### The Path Out

**See:** Recognize that what feels like attraction may be pattern-recognition in disguise. "Chemistry" with unavailable people is the old wound resonating, not evidence of compatibility. Available love may feel "boring" at first because it doesn't trigger the familiar intensity. This is information, not a flaw.

**Do:** Slow down the early stages of relationships. Notice the early signs of unavailability (inconsistency, vagueness about the future, keeping emotional distance) and treat them as data, not challenges to overcome. Practice: when you feel the pull toward someone uncertain, pause rather than pursue.

**Practice:** Mindfulness of the craving itself. When attraction arises, investigate: "What am I hoping to get here? Is this person actually capable of giving it? Or am I attracted to the trying?"

### Breaking the Chain

The most accessible intervention point is at the **craving-clinging transition**. This is the moment when attraction has arisen and you are about to act on it by pursuing, by hoping, by investing.

The practice: when you feel drawn to someone unavailable, do not immediately act. Sit with the craving. Feel it in the body. Notice the stories: "But they're different," "If I just show them..." Recognize these as craving-generated thoughts.

Ask: "What does this remind me of?" Often, the answer is: something old. Someone from before.

You do not have to override the craving through willpower. Simply seeing it clearly weakens its grip. When you see that the attraction is partially the wound calling out for healing - not genuine compatibility - choice becomes possible.

The chain continues as long as it operates in darkness. Bringing awareness to it is itself the beginning of freedom.
